  ## Project Description

  This project is a Team Profile Generator. The purpose of this project is to build a Team Profile Generator that will take information about employees on a software engineering team and
  generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries of each person. Since testing is key to making code maintainable, I have written a unit test for each part of my code to ensure that it passes each test.

  ## Installation 

Download the zip file and open the file in a terminal. 
  
  ## Usage

Run the command: node index.js

Fill in the prompts to create Team Profile Generator!
